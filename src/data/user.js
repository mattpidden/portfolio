Additionally, I am an avid sailor with a Yachtmaster Offshore certification. During the summer months, I work as a Yacht Skipper with a teenager based sail training organisation, where I have the privilege of sharing my passion for sailing with others. Combining my technical expertise with my love for the sea, I am constantly striving to explore innovative solutions and create impactful experiences in both the digital and maritime realms. In fact, I have just recently started working on a marine conservation data logging full stack application for the Univeristy's Scuba Diving Club."
